    "Description: GRASS GIS offers, besides other things, numerous analytical tools for point clouds, terrain, and remote sensing. In this hands-on workshop we will explore the tools in GRASS GIS for processing point clouds obtained by lidar or through processing of UAV imagery. We will start with a brief and focused introduction into GRASS GIS graphical user interface (GUI) and we will continue with short introduction to GRASS GIS Python interface. Participants will then decide if they will use GUI, command line, Python, or online Jupyter Notebook for the rest of the workshop. We will explore the properties of the point cloud, interpolate surfaces, and perform advanced terrain analyses to detect landforms and artifacts. We will go through several terrain 2D and 3D visualization techniques to get more information out of the data and finish with vegetation analysis.\n",
    "Requirements: This workshop is accessible to beginners, but some basic knowledge of lidar processing or GIS is helpful for a smooth experience.\n",

    "### GRASS GIS Spatial Database\n",
    "Here we provide an overview of [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org). For this exercise it's not necessary to have a full understanding of how to use GRASS GIS. However, you will need to know how to place your data in the correct GRASS GIS database directory, as well as some basic GRASS functionality.\n",
    "GRASS uses specific database terminology and structure ([GRASS GIS Spatial Database](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass72/manuals/grass_database.html)) that are important to understand for working in GRASS GIS efficiently. You will create a new location and import the required data into that location. In the following we review important terminology and give step by step directions on how to download and place your data in the correct place.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  A GRASS GIS Spatial Database (GRASS database) consists of directory with specific Locations (projects) where data (data layers/maps) are stored.\n",
    "*  Location is a directory with data related to one geographic location or a project. All data within one Location has the same coordinate reference system.\n",
    "*  Mapset is a collection of maps within Location, containing data related to a specific task, user or a smaller project.\n",
    "Start GRASS GIS, a start-up screen should appear.\n",
    "Unless you already have a directory called grassdata in your Documents directory (on MS Windows)\n",
    "or in your home directory (on Linux), create one. You can use the Browse button and the dialog in the GRASS GIS start up screen to do that.\n",
    "We will create a new location for our project with CRS (coordinate reference system) NC State Plane Meters with EPSG code 3358.\n",
    "Open Location Wizard with button New in the left part of the welcome screen. Select a name for the new location, select EPSG method and code 3358.\n",
    "When the wizard is finished, the new location will be listed on the start-up screen. Select the new location and mapset PERMANENT and press Start GRASS session.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a current working directory is a concept which is separate from the GRASS database, location and mapset discussed above. The current working directory is a directory where any program (no just GRASS GIS) writes and reads files unless a path to the file is provided. The current working directory can be changed from the GUI using Settings -> GRASS working environment -> Change working directory or from the Console using the cd command. This is advantageous when we are using command line and working with the same file again and again. This is often the case when working with lidar data. We can change the directory to the directory with the downloaded LAS file. IN case we don't change the directory, we need to provide full path to the file. Note that command line and GUI have their own settings of current working directory, so it needs to be changed separately for each of them."

The most often used functions include:\n",
    "\n",

The computational region can be defined before running the script so that the script can be used with different computational region settings.\n",

This can be done adding `overwrite=True` as an additional argument to the function call for each module or we can do it globally using `os.environ['GRASS_OVERWRITE'] = '1'` (requires `import os`).\n",
    "Finally, you may have noticed the first line of the script which says `#!/usr/bin/env python`. This is what Linux, Mac OS, and similar systems use to determine which interpreter to use. If you get something line `[Errno 8] Exec format error`, this line is probably incorrect or missing.\n",

At this point, we don't know the spatial extent of the point cloud, so we cannot set computation region ahead, but we can tell the [r.in.lidar](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass72/manuals/r.in.lidar.html) module to determine the extent first and use it for the output using the `-e` flag. We are using a coarse resolution to maximize the speed of the process. Additionally, the `-r` flag sets the computational region to match the output."
